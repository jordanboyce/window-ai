# Chrome Writer & Rewriter API Usage Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to use Chrome's built-in Writer and Rewriter APIs for intelligent content creation and enhancement.

## Overview

Chrome's Writing Assistance APIs provide on-device content creation and transformation capabilities:

- **Writer API**: Creates new content from writing task descriptions
- **Rewriter API**: Transforms and enhances existing text with specific improvements

Both APIs support streaming responses, availability checking, and advanced configuration options for tone, format, and length.

## Prerequisites

### Browser Support

1. **Writer & Rewriter APIs**:
    - Developer trial / behind flags on desktop in Chrome Canary 157. Enable on localhost via `chrome://flags/#writer-api` and `chrome://flags/#rewriter-api`.
    - Supported platforms: Windows, Mac, and Linux
    - Requires at least 22GB free storage for model download

### Setup Instructions

1. **Enable Writer API**:
    ```
    chrome://flags/#writer-api
    ```
    Set to `Enabled` and restart Chrome.

2. **Enable Rewriter API**:
    ```
    chrome://flags/#rewriter-api
    ```
    Set to `Enabled` and restart Chrome.

### Checking API Availability

```javascript
// Check Writer availability
const writerAvailability = await Writer.availability();
console.log('Writer:', writerAvailability); // "available", "downloadable", "downloading", or "unavailable"

// Check Rewriter availability
const rewriterAvailability = await Rewriter.availability();
console.log('Rewriter:', rewriterAvailability);

// Check specific configuration availability
const formalWriterAvailability = await Writer.availability({
  tone: "formal",
  format: "markdown",
  length: "long"
});
```

## Writer API

### Basic Writing

```javascript
const writer = await Writer.create({
  tone: "formal"
});

const result = await writer.write(
  "A draft for an inquiry to my bank about how to enable wire transfers on my account"
);

console.log(result);
writer.destroy();
```

### Creative Writing Examples

});

console.log(result);
rewriter.destroy();
```

### Creative Rewriting Examples

#### Professional Communication Enhancement
```javascript
const professionalRewriter = await Rewriter.create({
    tone: "more-formal",
  sharedContext: "Business communication requiring professional tone"
});

// Transform casual feedback into professional communication
const casualFeedback = `
  Hey, I think the new website design is pretty cool but there are some issues. 
  The navigation is kinda confusing and the colors are too bright. 
  Also, it loads super slow on my phone.
`;

const professionalFeedback = await professionalRewriter.rewrite(casualFeedback, {

  for this quarter.
`;

const executiveSummary = await lengthRewriter.rewrite(detailedNotes, {
  context: "Create concise executive summary focusing on key decisions and status"
});

lengthRewriter.destroy();
```

#### Creative Style Transformation
```javascript
const styleRewriter = await Rewriter.create({
  format: "markdown",
  sharedContext: "Creative content transformation and enhancement"
});

// Transform dry instructions into engaging tutorial
const dryInstructions = `
  To set up the software, first download the installer. Run the installer as administrator. 
  Select the installation directory. Choose the components to install. Click install and wait. 
  Restart your computer when prompted.
`;

const engagingTutorial = await styleRewriter.rewrite(dryInstructions, {
  context: "Make this into an engaging, step-by-step tutorial with helpful tips"
});

// Enhance product review with more descriptive language
const basicReview = `
  The headphones are good. Sound quality is nice. They're comfortable to wear. 
  Battery life is okay. Would recommend to others.
`;

const detailedReview = await styleRewriter.rewrite(basicReview, {
  context: "Expand into detailed, helpful review with specific examples and comparisons"
});

styleRewriter.destroy();
```

### Streaming Rewriting

```javascript
const rewriter = await Rewriter.create({
  tone: "more-formal",
  length: "longer"
});

const stream = rewriter.rewriteStreaming(originalText, {
  context: "Expand this into a comprehensive analysis with supporting details"
});

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log("Rewriting progress:", chunk);
  // Update UI progressively as content transforms
}
```

### Error Handling

#### Handling Quota Exceeded Errors

```javascript
const rewriter = await Rewriter.create();

try {
  const result = await rewriter.rewrite(veryLongDocument);
  console.log(result);
} catch (e) {
  if (e.name === "QuotaExceededError") {
    console.error(`Document too large! You tried to rewrite ${e.requested} tokens, but only ${e.quota} are supported.`);
    
    // Suggest breaking into smaller sections
    console.log(`Try breaking your document into sections of ${e.quota} tokens or less.`);
  }
}
```

#### Checking Input Quota

```javascript
const rewriter = await Rewriter.create({
  length: "longer"
});

const quota = rewriter.inputQuota;
const currentUsage = await rewriter.measureInputUsage(textToRewrite);

console.log(`Text uses ${currentUsage}/${quota} tokens`);

if (currentUsage > quota) {
  console.log("Text exceeds quota, consider splitting into sections");
}
```

### Cancellation and Abort Signals

```javascript
const controller = new AbortController();

// Cancel after 30 seconds
setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 30000);

try {
  const rewriter = await Rewriter.create({ 
    signal: controller.signal 
  });
  
  const result = await rewriter.rewrite(textToRewrite, { 
    context: "Make this more engaging",
    signal: controller.signal 
  });
  
  console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.name === "AbortError") {
    console.log("Rewriting was cancelled");
  }
}
```

## Using with TypeScript

```typescript
import {
  writeText,
  writeTextStreaming,
  rewriteText,
  rewriteTextStreaming,
  checkWriterAvailability,
  checkRewriterAvailability,
  type WriterOptions,
  type RewriterOptions,
  type AvailabilityStatus
} from '../services/WriterService';

// Writer usage
const content: string = await writeText("Write a product description", {
  tone: "casual",
  format: "markdown",
  length: "medium"
});

// Rewriter usage
const enhanced: string = await rewriteText(originalText, {
  tone: "more-formal",
  length: "longer"
}, "Make this suitable for executive presentation");

// Check availability
const writerStatus: AvailabilityStatus = await checkWriterAvailability({
  tone: "formal"
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Choose appropriate tones** for your target audience
2. **Use shared context** for consistent output across multiple operations
3. **Handle quota errors gracefully** by chunking large content
4. **Monitor download progress** for better user experience
5. **Clean up resources** by calling `destroy()` on writers and rewriters
6. **Cache instances** when processing multiple texts with same configuration
7. **Use streaming** for long content to provide progressive feedback
8. **Provide clear context** in rewrite operations for better results

## Conclusion

Chrome's Writer and Rewriter APIs provide powerful on-device content creation and enhancement capabilities. By following the patterns in this guide, you can build intelligent writing assistance features that help users create and improve content while maintaining privacy through local processing.
